# automatic-classroom-creator
Software that automatically allocates students to classrooms for the IIS F. Alberghetti high school. The project is based on a C++ randomised algorithm that tries to solve the complex optimisation problem, given certain constraints such as friendships and grade averages.
The task was previously performed by hand and was taking around 15 working person days.
